# Memory Bank Instructions - Munchies

## Overview## Usage Instructions

### For Every Development Session
1. **Read this file first** (`memory-bank-instructions.md`)
2. **Load all global context files** in this order:
   - `projectbrief.md` - Understand project vision
   - `productContext.md` - Understand product features
   - `systemPatterns.md` - Understand architecture patterns
   - `techContext.md` - Understand technology choices
   - `activeContext.md` - Understand current focus
   - `progress.md` - Understand current progress
   - `copilot-rules.md` - Understand development rules

3. **Load feature-specific files** if working on a specific feature:
   - Check if `.github/copilot/memory-bank/<feature>/` exists
   - Load all files in that directory

### Slash Commands
The Kiro-Lite workflow uses specific slash commands:

#### `/start feature <name>`
- Creates new feature folder with template files
- Initializes PRD intake process
- Example: `/start feature authentication`

#### `/approve prd`
- Moves from PRD phase to Design phase
- Only use after PRD is complete and reviewed

#### `/approve design`
- Moves from Design phase to Task Breakdown phase
- Only use after design is complete and reviewed

#### `/approve tasks`
- Moves from Task Breakdown to Code Generation phase
- Only use after tasks are complete and reviewed

#### `/implement <TASK_ID>`
- Implements specific task from tasks.md
- Shows file plan, diffs, and tests
- Example: `/implement AUTH-001`

#### `/review complete`
- Confirms implementation is done
- Waits for next command

#### `/update memory bank`
- Refreshes core memory files
- Updates activeContext.md and progress.md

## Workflow Phases

### Phase 0: PRD Intake
- Clarify scope and requirements with user
- Create structured PRD in feature folder
- Wait for `/approve prd` before proceeding

### Phase 1: Design Documentation
- Create technical design document
- Include architecture diagrams
- Define APIs and data models
- Wait for `/approve design` before proceeding

### Phase 2: Task Breakdown
- Break design into implementable tasks
- Assign unique IDs and effort estimates
- Define acceptance criteria
- Wait for `/approve tasks` before proceeding

### Phase 3: Code Generation
- Implement one task at a time
- Show all changes as diffs
- Include tests for new functionality
- Wait for `/review complete` after each task

## File Maintenance

### When to Update
- **activeContext.md**: Daily or after major changes
- **progress.md**: Weekly or after milestone completion
- **projectbrief.md**: Rarely, only for major pivots
- **productContext.md**: When features change significantly

**REMEMBER:**
After every memory reset, Copilot begins completely fresh. The Memory Bank is the only link to previous work. Maintain it with precision and clarityâ€”project effectiveness and security depend on its accuracy. memory bank system follows the Kiro-Lite methodology for structured development workflow. It provides persistent context and ensures consistent progress tracking across development sessions.

## Core Principle

**Copilot MUST read ALL memory bank files at the start of EVERY task.**

* No exceptions.
* Use this checklist before any work:

  * [ ] Read `.github/copilot/memory-bank/memory-bank-instructions.md` (this file)
  * [ ] Read `.github/copilot/memory-bank/projectbrief.md`
  * [ ] Read `.github/copilot/memory-bank/productContext.md`
  * [ ] Read `.github/copilot/memory-bank/systemPatterns.md`
  * [ ] Read `.github/copilot/memory-bank/techContext.md`
  * [ ] Read `.github/copilot/memory-bank/activeContext.md`
  * [ ] Read `.github/copilot/memory-bank/progress.md`
  * [ ] Read `.github/copilot/memory-bank/copilot-rules.md`
  * [ ] Read any feature-specific files in `.github/copilot/memory-bank/<feature>/`

## File Structure

### Global Context Files (Always Load)
```
.github/copilot/memory-bank/
â”œâ”€â”€ memory-bank-instructions.md  # This file - read first
â”œâ”€â”€ projectbrief.md              # Project vision and goals

## Core Workflows

### Plan Mode

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start[Start] --> ReadFiles[Read Memory Bank]
    ReadFiles --> CheckFiles{Files Complete?}
    CheckFiles -->|No| Plan[Create Plan]
    Plan --> Document[Document in Chat]
    CheckFiles -->|Yes| Verify[Verify Context]
    Verify --> Strategy[Develop Strategy]
    Strategy --> Present[Present Approach]
```

**Description:**

* Always start by reading all memory bank files.
* If files are missing, create a plan and document it.
* If files are complete, verify context and develop a strategy before acting.

### Act Mode

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start[Start] --> Context[Check Memory Bank]
    Context --> Update[Update Documentation]
    Update --> Rules[Update copilot-rules.md if needed]
    Rules --> Execute[Execute Task]
    Execute --> Document[Document Changes]
```

**Description:**

* Check memory bank before any action.
* Update documentation as you work.
* Update `.github/copilot/copilot-rules.md` if new patterns or rules are discovered.
* Document all changes.

## Documentation Updates

Update the Memory Bank when:

1. Discovering new project patterns or rules
2. After significant changes
3. When the user requests with **update memory bank** (review ALL files)
4. When context needs clarification

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start[Update Process]
    subgraph Process
        P1[Review ALL Files]
        P2[Document Current State]
        P3[Clarify Next Steps]
        P4[Update copilot-rules.md]
        P1 --> P2 --> P3 --> P4
    end
    Start --> Process
```

**Note:**
On **update memory bank**, review every file, even if some donâ€™t require changes.
Focus on `.github/copilot/memory-bank/activeContext.md` and `.github/copilot/memory-bank/progress.md` for current state.

## Project Rules (`.github/copilot/copilot-rules.md`)

This file is Copilotâ€™s and the teamâ€™s learning journal for the project. It captures:

* Critical implementation paths
* User preferences and workflow
* Project-specific patterns
* Security requirements and known challenges
* Evolution of project decisions
* Tool usage patterns

**Example: Core Security Rule**

```markdown
## ðŸš¨ Security: Never Upload Secrets

- Never copy, move, or commit secret files or values (e.g., `.env`, `secrets.json`, API keys, tokens, passwords) to version control or into example/sample config files.
- Example files like `.env.example` must be built by hand with only safe placeholder values.
- Always verify that no secrets are present before staging, committing, or pushing code.
- If a secret is ever committed, treat as a security incident: remove from history and rotate affected credentials immediately.
- Use secret scanning tools (e.g., GitHub Secret Scanning, TruffleHog, git-secrets) for extra safety.
```

## How to Use This Document

* Reference this file at the start of every session.
* Use the checklists and diagrams to guide your workflow.
* Update the Memory Bank and `.github/copilot/copilot-rules.md` as you learn.
* Treat this as a living documentâ€”improve it as the project evolves.

**REMEMBER:**
After every memory reset, Copilot begins completely fresh. The Memory Bank is the only link to previous work. Maintain it with precision and clarityâ€”project effectiveness and security depend on its accuracy.
