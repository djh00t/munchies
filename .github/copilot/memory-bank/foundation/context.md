# Foundation - Context

## Current Focus
Building the foundational infrastructure for the Munchies application, including development environment, database architecture, authentication system, and core API structure.

## Phase Status
- **Phase**: Foundation (Phase 1 of 5)
- **Week**: 1 of 4 in current phase
- **Progress**: 14% complete (2 of 14 tasks done)

## Active Development

### Recently Completed ✅
- **FOUND-001**: Repository and Monorepo Setup (2025-08-02)
  - GitHub repository initialized
  - npm workspaces configured
  - TypeScript setup complete
  
- **FOUND-003**: Backend API Foundation (2025-08-02)
  - Express.js server with TypeScript
  - Basic middleware stack
  - Prisma and Redis connections

### Currently Working On 🔄
- **FOUND-002**: Development Environment
  - Docker Compose configuration
  - Database and Redis containers
  - Development scripts and .env setup

### Next Priority 📋
1. **FOUND-004**: Database Schema Design
   - Complete entity relationship design
   - Implement Prisma schema
   - Create migrations and seed data

2. **FOUND-006**: OAuth Integration
   - Apple and Google Sign-In
   - User registration flow
   - Authentication middleware

## Technical Decisions Made

### Architecture Choices
- **Monorepo Structure**: npm workspaces for backend/web separation
- **Backend Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript for type safety
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM for robust data handling
- **Caching**: Redis for sessions and performance optimization
- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 + JWT for secure, scalable auth

### Development Environment
- **Containerization**: Docker Compose for consistent local development
- **Language**: TypeScript throughout for type safety
- **Code Quality**: ESLint and Prettier for consistent code style
- **Testing**: Jest for comprehensive test coverage

## Key Architectural Patterns

### API Design
- RESTful endpoints with consistent naming
- Structured error responses with proper HTTP status codes
- Request/response validation using TypeScript interfaces
- Middleware-based authentication and authorization

### Database Design
- UUID primary keys for security and scalability
- Proper foreign key relationships and constraints
- JSONB fields for flexible preference storage
- Optimized indexing for query performance

### Security Implementation
- OAuth 2.0 for authentication (Apple, Google)
- JWT tokens with refresh mechanism
- Rate limiting and request validation
- Secure environment variable management

## Current Challenges

### Technical Challenges
1. **Database Schema Complexity**: Balancing flexibility with performance
2. **OAuth Integration**: Managing multiple provider configurations
3. **Development Environment**: Ensuring consistency across team members
4. **Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive coverage without over-testing

### Process Challenges
1. **Task Dependencies**: Some tasks blocked until infrastructure complete
2. **Documentation**: Keeping documentation current with rapid changes
3. **Quality Standards**: Maintaining high standards while moving quickly

## Resource Allocation

### Current Team Focus
- **Backend Development**: 70% (primary infrastructure work)
- **DevOps/Infrastructure**: 20% (Docker, CI/CD setup)
- **Documentation**: 10% (keeping memory bank current)

### Skill Requirements
- **Strong**: Node.js/TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Docker
- **Moderate**: OAuth implementation, Testing frameworks
- **Learning**: Prisma ORM, Redis optimization

## Dependencies and Blockers

### External Dependencies
- OAuth provider configurations (Apple, Google)
- Docker and container orchestration
- Database design consensus
- CI/CD platform access

### Current Blockers
- None at this time

### Potential Future Blockers
- OAuth provider approval processes
- Database migration complexity
- Performance optimization requirements

## Quality Metrics

### Code Quality
- **Test Coverage Target**: 80% minimum
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage
- **Code Style**: ESLint/Prettier enforcement
- **Security**: No hardcoded secrets, proper validation

### Performance Targets
- **API Response Time**: <200ms for 95% of requests
- **Database Queries**: <100ms for simple operations
- **Container Startup**: <30 seconds for full stack
- **Memory Usage**: <512MB per service container

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk ✅
- Repository setup and configuration
- Basic API structure implementation
- Development tooling setup

### Medium Risk ⚠️
- Database schema design decisions
- OAuth provider integration complexity
- Development environment consistency

### High Risk ❌
- None currently identified

## Success Criteria for Foundation Phase

### Must Have
- [ ] Complete Docker development environment
- [ ] Functional database with all core tables
- [ ] Working OAuth authentication
- [ ] Core API endpoints operational
- [ ] Basic testing framework in place

### Should Have
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline functional
- [ ] API documentation complete
- [ ] Error handling comprehensive
- [ ] Performance monitoring setup

### Nice to Have
- [ ] Advanced testing scenarios
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Advanced security features
- [ ] Comprehensive logging

## Lessons Learned

### What's Working Well
- Monorepo structure simplifies dependency management
- TypeScript catching errors early in development
- Docker providing consistent development environment
- Clear task breakdown enabling focused work

### Areas for Improvement
- Need more detailed acceptance criteria for complex tasks
- Better estimation of task dependencies
- More frequent progress updates to memory bank
- Clearer definition of "done" for each task

## Future Considerations

### Scaling Preparation
- Database connection pooling strategy
- Caching layer optimization
- API rate limiting implementation
- Monitoring and alerting setup

### Feature Development Readiness
- Authentication system must be solid before user features
- Database schema should accommodate future feature needs
- API patterns should be consistent and well-documented
- Testing patterns should be established early
