# Foundation - PRD

## Problem Statement
The Munchies project needs a solid foundation infrastructure before implementing any user-facing features. Without proper setup of development environment, database architecture, authentication, and core API structure, feature development will be inefficient and error-prone.

## Success Criteria
- Complete development environment with Docker containers
- Functional database schema with migrations
- Working authentication system with OAuth
- Core API endpoints operational
- CI/CD pipeline functional
- Testing framework established

## Requirements

### FR-001: Development Environment Setup
- Docker Compose configuration for local development
- PostgreSQL database container with persistent storage
- Redis cache container for session management
- Environment variable management (.env files)
- Development scripts for common tasks

### FR-002: Database Architecture
- Complete database schema design for all entities
- Prisma ORM integration with TypeScript
- Database migration system
- Seed data for development and testing
- Proper indexing for performance

### FR-003: Authentication System
- OAuth 2.0 integration (Apple, Google)
- JWT token management with refresh tokens
- User profile management
- Role-based access control foundation
- Session management with Redis

### FR-004: Core API Structure
- RESTful API endpoints with proper error handling
- Request/response validation
- Rate limiting and security middleware
- API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)
- Health check and monitoring endpoints

### FR-005: Testing Framework
- Unit testing setup with Jest
- Integration testing for API endpoints
- Test database configuration
- Code coverage reporting
- Automated testing in CI/CD

### FR-006: CI/CD Pipeline
- GitHub Actions workflow
- Automated testing on pull requests
- Docker image building and publishing
- Deployment automation to staging
- Security scanning and dependency checks

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- API response times under 200ms for basic operations
- Database query optimization
- Efficient Docker container startup times
- Fast development environment setup

### Security
- Secure OAuth implementation
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Secure environment variable handling

### Reliability
- Graceful error handling and recovery
- Database connection resilience
- Container health checks
- Automated backup procedures
- Monitoring and alerting setup

## Non-Requirements
- User-facing features (recipes, meal planning)
- Mobile application setup
- Payment processing integration
- External API integrations (Spoonacular, AI)
- Advanced deployment strategies (auto-scaling, blue-green)

## Acceptance Criteria

### Development Environment
- [ ] Docker Compose starts all services successfully
- [ ] Database migrations run without errors
- [ ] Development scripts execute correctly
- [ ] Hot reloading works for code changes
- [ ] Environment variables load properly

### Database
- [ ] All tables created with proper relationships
- [ ] Migrations run forward and backward correctly
- [ ] Seed data populates successfully
- [ ] Queries perform within acceptable limits

### Authentication
- [ ] OAuth flows complete successfully
- [ ] JWT tokens generate and validate correctly
- [ ] User registration and login functional
- [ ] Session management works with Redis
- [ ] Protected routes enforce authentication

### API
- [ ] All planned endpoints respond correctly
- [ ] Error handling returns proper status codes
- [ ] Input validation prevents bad data
- [ ] Rate limiting blocks excessive requests
- [ ] API documentation is accurate

### Testing
- [ ] Unit tests achieve >80% code coverage
- [ ] Integration tests verify API functionality
- [ ] Test database isolates test data
- [ ] CI pipeline runs tests automatically
- [ ] Test reports generate correctly

### CI/CD
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow completes successfully
- [ ] Docker images build and push correctly
- [ ] Deployment to staging works automatically
- [ ] Security scans pass without issues
- [ ] Quality gates enforce standards

## Dependencies
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- PostgreSQL 14+
- Redis 6+
- GitHub account with Actions enabled

## Risks
- Docker environment complexity
- Database schema design changes
- OAuth provider configuration issues
- CI/CD pipeline reliability
- Development environment consistency across team

## Timeline
- Week 1: Development environment and database setup
- Week 2: Authentication system implementation
- Week 3: Core API development and testing
- Week 4: CI/CD pipeline and documentation completion
