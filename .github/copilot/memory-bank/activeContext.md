- Create .env.example files

### Next Priority Tasks
ðŸ“‹ **Task FOUND-002**: Development Environment (IN PROGRESS)
- Create Docker Compose configuration
- Set up PostgreSQL database container  
- Set up Redis cache container
- Configure development scripts
- Create .env.example files

ðŸ“‹ **Task FOUND-004**: Database Schema Design (NEXT)
- Design and create user tables
- Design and create inventory tables
- Design and create recipe tables
- Design and create meal plan tables
- Set up database migrations
- Create seed data for development

## Current Development Context

### Active Branch
- `dev/phase1` - Foundation development branch
- Preparing for PR #6 merge with updated documentation

### Development Environment
- Debian GNU/Linux 11 (bullseye) dev container
- Node.js, npm, eslint pre-installed
- Git, Docker, and development tools available

### Available Tasks
Multiple VS Code tasks configured:
- Install Dependencies
- Start Development (Full Stack)
- Database: Migrate/Seed
- Docker: Start/Stop Services
- Build/Lint/Test workflows

## Immediate Development Focus

### Priority 1: Infrastructure Completion
- Complete Docker development environment
- Finalize database schema and migrations
- Set up proper environment configuration

### Priority 2: Core Features Foundation  
- User authentication system
- Basic inventory management
- Recipe data integration setup

### Priority 3: Development Workflow
- CI/CD pipeline setup
- Testing framework implementation
- Code quality and linting configuration

## Blockers and Dependencies

### Current Blockers
- None identified at this time

### External Dependencies
- Spoonacular API access (for recipe data)
- GitHub AI API access (for conversational features)
- Cloud storage setup (for image processing)
- OAuth provider configuration (Apple/Google)

## Key Decisions Pending
1. Final database schema validation
2. Image storage and OCR service selection
3. Deployment infrastructure choice
4. Testing strategy implementation
5. API versioning approach

## Resource Allocation
- **Backend Development**: Primary focus (60%)
- **Infrastructure Setup**: Secondary focus (30%)
- **Documentation/Planning**: Ongoing (10%)

## Risk Factors
- External API rate limits and costs
- Image processing performance requirements
- User authentication complexity
- Database performance at scale

## Success Metrics for Current Phase
- Complete foundation infrastructure setup
- Working local development environment
- Basic API endpoints operational
- Database schema implemented and tested
- CI/CD pipeline functional
