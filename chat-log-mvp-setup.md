# Munchies MVP Development Chat Log

**Date:** 2025-08-02  
**Session:** MVP Implementation Setup

## Summary
This chat session focused on implementing the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) for the Munchies application, setting up the core project structure and getting foundational components running.

## Actions Taken

### 1. Project Structure Setup
- Created monorepo structure with npm workspaces
- Set up packages directory for backend, web, mobile, admin components
- Configured root package.json with workspace scripts

### 2. Backend API Foundation
- Created Express.js server with TypeScript
- Set up basic route structure for:
  - Authentication (`/api/auth`)
  - Inventory Management (`/api/inventory`)
  - Recipe Management (`/api/recipes`)
  - Meal Planning (`/api/meal-plans`)
  - Shopping Lists (`/api/shopping-lists`)
  - AI Chat (`/api/chat`)
- Implemented error handling middleware
- Added Winston logging utility
- Created health check endpoints

### 3. Docker Development Environment
- Created docker-compose.yml for development
- Configured PostgreSQL database container
- Configured Redis cache container
- Set up backend service container
- Added proper healthchecks and dependencies

### 4. Environment Configuration
- Created comprehensive .env.example file
- Set up development environment variables
- Configured security and API keys structure

### 5. TypeScript Configuration
- Set up TypeScript configuration for backend
- Configured proper type definitions and build settings

## Files Created

### Root Level
- `package.json` - Monorepo configuration with workspaces
- `docker-compose.yml` - Docker development environment
- `.env.example` - Environment variables template
- `briefing.md` - Original chat transcript
- `REQUIREMENTS.md` - Project requirements document
- `DESIGN.md` - System architecture and design
- `TASKS.md` - Task management and project phases

### Backend Package
- `packages/backend/package.json` - Backend dependencies
- `packages/backend/tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration
- `packages/backend/src/index.ts` - Main Express server
- `packages/backend/src/utils/logger.ts` - Winston logging utility
- `packages/backend/src/middleware/errorHandler.ts` - Error handling middleware
- `packages/backend/src/routes/` - API route handlers for all services

## Next Steps (MVP Implementation Priority)

### Phase 1: Foundation (Current Status)
- ✅ Repository and monorepo setup
- ✅ Development environment configuration
- ✅ Backend API foundation
- ⏳ Database schema design and setup
- ⏳ Web application foundation

### Phase 2: Core Features (Next)
- User onboarding and preferences
- Basic inventory management
- Recipe integration (Spoonacular API)
- Simple meal planning
- Shopping list functionality

### Phase 3: MVP Launch Features
- Basic authentication (OAuth)
- Photo-based inventory (simplified)
- Recipe suggestions based on inventory
- Simple meal planning interface
- Shopping list generation

## Technical Decisions Made

1. **Monorepo Structure**: Using npm workspaces for better code sharing and development experience
2. **Backend Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript for rapid development
3. **Database**: PostgreSQL for reliability and complex queries
4. **Caching**: Redis for API response caching and session management
5. **Development**: Docker Compose for consistent development environment
6. **Logging**: Winston for structured logging and debugging

## Development Environment Status

- ✅ Monorepo configuration
- ✅ Backend package structure
- ✅ Docker Compose configuration
- ✅ Environment variables setup
- ⏳ Database initialization
- ⏳ Web application setup
- ⏳ Mobile application setup

## Key Insights

1. **MVP Focus**: Prioritizing core inventory and meal planning features over advanced AI and monetization features
2. **Development Speed**: Using familiar technologies (Express, PostgreSQL) for rapid MVP development
3. **Architecture**: Designed for scalability but implemented with simplicity for MVP

## User Requirements Addressed

- ✅ Photo-based inventory management (structure ready)
- ✅ Recipe management system (API endpoints created)
- ✅ Meal planning functionality (routes established)
- ✅ Shopping list management (foundation set)
- ✅ Conversational AI integration (endpoints ready)
- ✅ Multi-platform support (web/mobile architecture)

This chat session successfully established the foundational infrastructure for the Munchies MVP, setting up a robust development environment and creating the basic API structure needed to implement core features.
