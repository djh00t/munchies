## User:  
Write a mobile and web app that allows me to take a photo of my fridge cupboard or shopping receipt to add food to my inventory. I can save food likes/dislikes and style preferences. It should walk me through a wizard to set them. I can also just say I have x, y, z food that I want to cook with and it provides me with recipe options. You provide feedback on recipes to help further tune preferences and recipes over time.

It should use the spoonacular api for food/recipe options but should  also save them when retrieved so we have a cache of recipes on our servers to minimise requests.

I also want the core feature to have a shopping and meal planner that knows what you have in stock and the time/effort you're prepared to put in for each meal or if you're prepared to batch cook meals ahead it will help you plan based on this. The inventory feature needs to be flexible and not demand high levels of maintenance. "Do you have... x" if it's not in the inventory should be a question/option while planning meals. Also items that were added to inventory a long time ago or which are frequently used or expire quickly should also not be assumed to be there even if in the inventory.  

It should keep a shopping list.  

The app should use the GitHub ai api's for its features and be conversational, maybe even use voice as an option between the user and app.  

The app will allow Apple and Google signup/sign in.  

The app website should provide all the options the app does. The site should have a blog and public recipes section to attract traffic.

Revenue streams will be:

- advertising/product promotion/affiliate referrals on YouTube, TikTok, Twitter, Facebook, blog and recipes
- paid advanced menu planner features
- paid advanced shopping list features
- paid advanced inventory management
- integrations with Cole's/Woolies/Wholefoods/Amazon or whoever will deliver
- shadow kitchen delivery services "don't feel like cooking this but want to eat it..? Click here"

I want an admin panel for content management, billing, affiliate tracking and other stuff.  

Must be really easy to use, simple for busy people to eat well, eat a variety of food and to minimise waste.

## Copilot Assistant:  
I'll help you create a comprehensive meal planning and inventory management app. Let me break this down into a structured implementation plan and create the necessary files for this project.

### Project Overview: SmartMeal Planner

This will be a full-stack application with:
- React Native mobile app (iOS/Android)
- Next.js web application
- Node.js/Express backend
- PostgreSQL database
- Redis for caching
- Integration with Spoonacular API
- GitHub AI APIs for conversational features

Let me create the initial project structure and key files:

---

**(Code agent invoked: Initial scaffold creation for SmartMeal Planner)**

I've initiated the creation of your SmartMeal Planner application. This comprehensive solution will include:

### Key Features Being Implemented:

#### 1. Inventory Management
- Photo capture for fridge/cupboard/receipts using OCR
- Flexible inventory tracking that doesn't require high maintenance
- Smart expiration and usage pattern tracking
- "Do you have X?" prompts for uncertain items

#### 2. Personalization & Preferences
- Onboarding wizard for food preferences
- Like/dislike tracking
- Cooking style preferences
- Time/effort preferences for meal planning
- Learning from recipe feedback

#### 3. Recipe & Meal Planning
- Spoonacular API integration with server-side caching
- Recipe suggestions based on available ingredients
- Batch cooking support
- Time/effort-aware meal planning
- Conversational recipe discovery

#### 4. Shopping & Planning
- Smart shopping list generation

- Meal planning calendar
- Inventory-aware shopping suggestions

#### 5. Monetization Features
- Freemium model with premium features
- Admin panel for content management
- Affiliate tracking system

- Blog and public recipe sections for SEO

#### 6. Technical Architecture
- **Backend:** Node.js/Express with TypeScript
- **Database:** PostgreSQL for data, Redis for caching
- **Web:** Next.js for SEO-friendly web app
- **Mobile:** React Native for cross-platform app
- **AI:** GitHub AI APIs for conversational features

## User:
Great let's create a new repo and put the code in it. We will call it djh00t/munchies for the moment.

---

## Copilot Assistant:
I'll create the new repository and set up the SmartMeal Planner (Munchies) project for you.

---

**(GitHub write: Repository creation for djh00t/munchies)**

---

Now let me create the comprehensive project structure with all the necessary files:

---

**(Code agent invoked: Full monorepo structure for djh00t/munchies, including backend, web, mobile, admin, shared, database, and documentation)**

---

I've created the Munchies repository and set up the complete project structure! The repository is now live at `djh00t/munchies` with a comprehensive meal planning and inventory management application.

### Next Steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/djh00t/munchies.git
   cd munchies
   ```

2. **Set up the development environment:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your API keys
   docker-compose up -d
   npm run db:migrate
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Configure API keys:**
   - Get a Spoonacular API key from https://spoonacular.com/food-api
   - Set up OAuth apps for Google and Apple sign-in
   - Configure GitHub AI API access
   - Set up Stripe for payments

4. **Start developing:**
   - Backend API runs on http://localhost:3001
   - Web app runs on http://localhost:3000
   - Admin panel runs on http://localhost:3002

The application is now ready for development! All core features are scaffolded and ready to be enhanced. The architecture supports all your requirements including photo-based inventory, AI-powered conversations, flexible meal planning, and multiple revenue streams.
